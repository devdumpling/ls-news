## Inspiration

After reading Cal Newport's _Deep Work_ I realized that I spend so much time glancing at headlines and quick summaries of news alongside and endless stream of fluff. Cal's suggestion for eliminating this fluff is to completely tune out all news sites as they're distracting and lead to shallow work. He admits this is straight up impossible for many workers, and downright unfun for many others. Personally, I don't care too much about most of the news, but in {CURRENT YEAR} it seems like there has to be some middle ground. 

That is, I wanted to get the top stories highlighted from across the web (or some subset of it) without all the distraction and fluff. I wanted `ls` but for news. Minimal, sleek, optimized such that I can stay aware without getting sucked into filler articles and clickbait. I intentionally designed this service to give summaries, and disallow the linking to other articles unless explicitly configured by the user to do so. 

The thought was if something really catches my eye I'll go look it up. It's a deterrent from spending unnecessary time reading articles and getting sucked into the rabbit hole. Again, give me the info and that's it. 

## Where is the project at currently?

It's in its infancy.
